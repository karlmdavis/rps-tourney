/**
 * <p>
 * Models a given play session of the game: tracking the moves that have been made, determining the winner (if any),
 * etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are the rules:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each game will last a pre-specified (odd) number of rounds.</li>
 * <li>Each round of the game, players select a {@link Throw}.</li>
 * <li>If the two throws are different, one of the players will have won the round. If the two throws are the same, the
 * players have tied. Tied rounds do not count towards the agreed-upon total number of rounds.</li>
 * <li>{@link Throw#ROCK} beats {@link Throw#SCISSORS}, {@link Throw#SCISSORS} beats {@link Throw#PAPER}, and
 * {@link Throw#PAPER} beats {@link Throw#ROCK}. (This logic is captured in {@link GameRound#getResult()}.)</li>
 * <li>The player that wins the most rounds wins the game. (The game stops at whatever point it becomes impossible for
 * one player to win.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> This class is not at all immutable or thread-safe. It's the responsibility of the
 * application using the class to ensure that conflicting modifications aren't made. In the common case, where the
 * {@link Game} is being used with a database, it's recommended that each single operation on the {@link Game} be a
 * pessimistic transaction. This allows the database to act as the mediator/enforcer of thread safety.

	 *
	 * if (!game.isRoundPrepared()) {

	 * <p>
	 * The call to {@link #prepareRound()} will first check to see if the game is still in progress or if it has been
	 * won. If it's been won, it will set {@link #getState()} to {@link State#FINISHED}. If it's still in-progress, it
	 * will create the next {@link GameRound} and append it to {@link #getRounds()}. Subsequent calls
	 * {@link #prepareRound()} within the same actual round will not do anything.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Caution:</strong> If the {@link Game} being used is persistent (to a DB via JPA), then any call to this
	 * method must be be made by itself in a single transaction. Please note that multiple concurrent calls to
	 * {@link #prepareRound()} by clients with different copies of the {@link Game} (from the DB) may lead to DB
	 * constraint violations for some of the calls. Such errors can be safely ignored, as they simply indicate that
	 * another client's call was successful.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Design note: Originally, this method's logic was part of {@link #submitThrow(int, Player, Throw)}. However, in
	 * the face of concurrent clients/players, it's quite likely that both players will make their move at the same
	 * time, and thus each copy of the {@link Game} will not realize that the round is complete. By splitting this logic
	 * into a separate method, we also ensure that {@link #submitThrow(int, Player, Throw)} won't generate DB constraint
	 * errors; isolating the logic that might cause such errors in a separate method seems prudent.
